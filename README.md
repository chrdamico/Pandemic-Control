Repository for a project of the course "Optimal Control" at La Sapienza University. This project was completed by Christian D'Amico and Danilo Menegatti.

Aim of the project was using Optimal Control theory to contain an epidemic by optimally allocating cures and vaccines.

Thus, an SIR model was built and controlled optimally using the Forwards-Backwards method as solving method for the optimal control problem.

Then, wanting to tackle a real world example, real world data coming from the 2016 Ebola epidemic in western Africa (from the WHO) was considered. Starting from this, it is possible to estimate the parameters of a SIR model and use them to find an optimal resource allocation strategy.

Estimating parameters of very complex models from small datasets of real world data is surprisingly cumbersome. Hence, the final simulations were performed on a simplified model.

Final output of the project was a report (available here) and a Powepoint presentation.
